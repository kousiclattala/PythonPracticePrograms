# PythonPracticePrograms
This is a 30-day Competitive Python Programming Practice Questions.

This is for those people who want to start Competitive Python Programming but can't solve the problems. By Practicing these Programs You will feel confident and can start your competitve programming journey.

# Note:
Please, don't look into the solution, by not trying to solving the program first. It is not a good habit. 
If you want to be good a Programming then try to solve on your own, don't feel bad if you don't get it when you solving it. 
For some people they can solve a Particular Program in few hours but for some it may take few days. But one day you will get it.
so don't worry about it ,try and solve it in different way if still you don't get it then look into the solution and try to understand the logic in which the other person has written
Then type that code on your own and practice it for few times then you will remembered the logic.

If anyone Interested to contribute more programs to this Module, All ways welcome.

Thanks,
Happy Codingüëçüòä
